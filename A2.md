## Assignment 2
**What my website is**
This is a homepage for a website that would take health data from an individual, compare  it with weather data, and give the person the information they need to be most comfortable that day.
**Competative analysis** 
I couldnt find any ideas similar ideas exactly what I have, which would make since as I dont think the market would be big enough, mainly because most people can look at the weather app and figure out what they need on their own. Which is why I chose the weather.com. There was a lot going on, even compared to other major websites, roughly half of what was presented as you first inspected the home page was ads, which I also noticed they were labled as ads in the code as well. They also use a ton of iFrame due to the ads, but also to show news stories, maps, and other data.
**GitHubResearch**
I found something called water.css. It is something someone made so they can have easy access to styling their website and for others to use as well. It was meant to look good and simple, and it did. the readme gave a breakdown of what it was for and how one could use and access the code. I honestly would have used it, but I need the practice figuring stuff out on my own for this assignment.
**Recources** I did use chat GPT for website content. I used it to write out the three paragraphs explaining the different ways weather can effect your health in my home page. My input to chat chatGPT was "in a paragraph explain how X weather condition can effect health"
